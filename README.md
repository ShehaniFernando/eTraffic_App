# etraffic

* A new Flutter project.

* This project is about the etraffic application.

* "eTraffic Police" is an application developed by the Sri Lankan Traffic Police which allows the public to report traffic violations by uploading images or videos taken through the application as evidence which is sent to the database in the traffic HQ in real time with the location, and the user can also choose to add a desctiption/comment regarding the violation. All the information is received by the police IT division and traffic HQ where the operations team can initiate whatever the action that is required. And once the case is resolved, the user will be notified with the status of the action.

* The application has no functionality to upload media that is already available in the gallery since users should be restricted from uploading edited images/videos, which is subjects to the Motor Traffic(Amendment) Act (No. of 1984) and evidence (Special Provisions) Act. No. 14 of 1995
